# MaterialsBase

This Julia package will be created and used for materials analysis for my last high school research project.
As such, code and documentation in this package are part of the research project.
Contributions for this project is limited to the proponents.

## Contents

Currently, the plans for the project are to include **three** major methodologies in analysis:

1. N-Point Statistics Modeling from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/material-informatics)
2. Basic X-Ray Diffraction Analysis
3. Quantum Transport and Density Functional Theory
